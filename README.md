Ecstazy Nissan 300ZX Diagnostic Tuning Suite

This is the engine management software I used in my 300zx as part of the 
GeekMyRide project :

Ecstazy is a CLI-based tool (with some ncurses) that allows you to: display and 
edit parameters and tune Nissan 300ZX ECU ROM files; read and write 32k ROM 
files using the Xtronics Pocket Romulator; display engine sensor output in real 
time from the Consult serial diagnostic port (while tuning/editing); perform 
some basic active tests using the Consult diagnostic port; and display wideband 
o2 output in real time (only tested with AEM wideband, but it may work with 
others).
